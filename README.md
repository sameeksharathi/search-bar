##Search-bar

1. On typing in the search input box, the search results list opens up. The search could be just a string matching search.
2. Matching text should be highlighted in blue color as displayed in the search result list UI
3. If a search query is found in items, then it should show “{{queryValue}} found in items”, as displayed in
the search result list UI. Eg: “john” found in items
4. The list of cards can be navigated through keyboard or mouse
5. Only one card should highlight at a time if both mouse and keyboard are used for navigation
6. Keyboard will take preference if mouse is kept hovered on the list, similarly mouse will take preference if keyboard navigation is not used
7. This behavior is similar to how youtube search works https://www.youtube.com/
8. When no search results are found, an empty card is displayed
9. The card list would be scrollable
10. The highlighted card (via keyboard/mouse) will scroll into view
